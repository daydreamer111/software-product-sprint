            <h1>Jackie's Portfolio</h1>
                <h2>A little introduction</h2>
                <p>My full name is Monica Jaqueline Iniguez Moncada but I prefer to be called Jackie! I'm a second-year Computer Science Engineering student at Tecnologico de Monterrey Campus Guadalajara (I live in Mexico where I was also born and raised). My hobbies are listening to music, reading, watching series and (before covid) playing tenis.</p>
                <p>I've always loved maths and sciences, so I knew I was gonna be an engineer since I was little. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was around 8 years old so I'm always fidgeting and moving (adjusting to online classes has been an interesting challenge).</p>
                <p>I also have a lovely Chihuahua puppy that makes my family's life interesting during this pandemic. (A picture of her looking out through the window is shown bellow.)</p>

                <p>One of the projects above is on my <a href="https://github.com/daydreamer111">Github</a> and I'm still working on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/monica-jaqueline-i%C3%B1iguez-moncada-6295351a9/">LinkedIn</a> to add my projects there, too.</p>

                <h2>Talents and Interests</h2>
                <p>A random fact about me (that could or could not be considered a hidden talent) is that I can imitate the sound (and voices) of parrots and the barking of dogs. Another fun fact, I'm really good at Tetris which is also the only game I have never grown tired of.</p>
